Welcome to WiBench (Y-bench), an open-source configurable kernel suite for benchmarking wireless communication systems.
It contains the key signal processing kernels in several mainstream wireless protocols, and a complete LTE uplink system.
WiBench provide an easy configurable interface that users can easily change configurations and put kernels together to build their own systems.

This version of WiBench has been tested with gcc-4.5, 4.6, 4,7 and fftw-3.

Please see the license notice in the file LICENSE in the root directory of WiBench. 

This file contains instructions on downloading, building and running WiBench. 
More information about WiBench design philosiphy, kernel introduction and profiling performance can be found on the WiBench website (http://wibench.eecs.umich.edu).

If you have questions, please contact with the designers on the WiBench website.
Questions answered on a best effort basis.

See file CHANGES for updates in all versions.

1. DOWNLOAD
========================
Option 1:
  Go to http://wibench.eecs.umich.edu/download, and get the zipped source code.

Option 2:
  //TODO
  Github
git clone git://dev.ece.ubc.ca/gpgpu-sim

2. BUILD WiBench
========================
a) Dependencies
WiBench is developed on Ubuntu Linux, and has been used on Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04. 
In principle, WiBench should work with any linux distribution as long as the following software dependencies are satisfied. 
Here is a list of required softwares to build and run WiBench.
* gcc
* g++
* make
* libfftw-3

The fftw-3 library is highly recommended to be installed through the package manager of the operating system. 
For Ubuntu users, please install fftw-3 library through "apt-get install libfftw3".
The self-built fftw-3 library from the source code downloaded from the FFTW website has not been tested. 
So it is possible that the current version of WiBench is not compitable with it. 
We are still working on it, and will provide a more portable version of WiBench.

b) Compiling
Assuming all dependencies required by WiBench are installed on your system, to compile WiBench all you first need to add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file (assuming the WiBench root directory is in /home/user/wibench/):

  export WiBench_INSTALL_DIR=/home/user/wibench/

then, choose the category you want to build: 
1) for kernels, run 

make kernel

2) for app, run 

make app

3) for all, run 

make

4) To clean the build, run 

make clean

3. RUN WiBench 
========================
The executable files are stored in $(wibench_root)/build.
Each kernel has two running modes: with random inputs and with reference inputs. 

4. Directory Structure 
========================
